This repo contains the various citizen science project builder notebooks. The notebooks can be used in the Rubin Science Platform Notebook Aspect environment to curate data that can then be sent to the Zooniverse platform such that new subject sets can be created from Rubin data.

## Data Panel Review

Projects must be approved by the Rubin Data Rights Panel before a Zooniverse project goes live. Your initial curated data will be reviewed by the data panel and must not exceed 100 objects (100 distinct astro image cutouts, etc.)

In order for the Data Rights Panel to review your code, complete the following steps:

1. Curate your data using a citizen science notebook
2. Leave all cell output visible, do not clear it out
3. With the citizen science notebook tab in focus in the browser, go to File->Download, this will download the notebook with all of the cell output
4. Attach the downloaded notebook to an email
5. Email the notebook with a message explaining the nature of the data and how you curated to (data rights panel email forthcoming)
